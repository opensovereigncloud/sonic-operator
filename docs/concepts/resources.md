All CRDs are **cluster-scoped** and reconciled by switch-operator.

## Switch
Represents a physical switch and its management connectivity.

Spec fields:
- `management.host`: switch management host/IP.
- `management.port`: management port (string).
- `management.credentials`: reference to `SwitchCredentials`.
- `macAddress`: MAC address assigned to the switch.
- `ports[]`: declared list of physical port names.

Status fields:
- `state`: `Pending`, `Ready`, `Failed`.
- `macAddress`: observed switch MAC.
- `firmwareVersion`: observed SONiC OS version.
- `sku`: observed hardware SKU.
- `ports[]`: observed ports and interface references.

## SwitchInterface
Represents a single interface and its admin/operational state.

Spec fields:
- `handle`: interface handle on the device (e.g. `Ethernet0`).
- `switchRef`: reference to the owning `Switch`.
- `adminState`: desired admin state (`Up`, `Down`, `Unknown`).

Status fields:
- `adminState`: observed admin state.
- `operationalState`: observed operational state.
- `neighbor`: neighbor details (when available).
